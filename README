Distance Geometry repository

This repository is meant to contain several software tools for distance geometry.

This initial commit is for a new Java project (named javaCMP) that implements a
multi-representation system for a given simple directed graph.

The scientific article motivating and introducing the javaCMP project is:

A. Mucherino,
The Coherent Multi-Representation Problem with Applications in Structural Biology,
to appear in Lectures Notes in Computer Science, 
Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series, 
Proceedings of IWBBIO23, Gran Canaria, Spain, 
July 2023.

The article is also available on HAL open archives.
